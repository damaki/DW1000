--  @summary
--  Types and functions for dealing with time derived from the DW1000 system
--  time (clocked at 63.8976 GHz).
--
--  @description
--  The DW1000's system time is used for several 40-bit timestamps which are
--  measured in units of approx. 15.65 picoseconds. The timestamps which use
--  this 40-bit 63.8976 GHz system time are listed below:
--    * System Time Counter (SYS_TIME register)
--    * Delayed Send or Receive Time (DX_TIME register)
--    * Adjusted Receive Timestamp (RX_STAMP field in the RX_TIME register)
--    * Raw Receive Timestamp (RX_RAWST field in the RX_TIME register)
--    * Adjusted Transmit Timestamp (TX_STAMP field in the TX_TIME register)
--    * Raw Transmit Timestamp (TX_RAWST field in the TX_TIME register)
--
--  Out of the above registers, not all are capable of measuring to the full
--  40-bit granularity of 15.65 picoseconds. In some registers the 9 least
--  significant bits are ignored which gives 512x less precision, i.e. the
--  effective granularity is 8.013 nanoseconds. The registers that are capable
--  of the FULL precision of 15.65 picoseconds are listed below:
--    * Adjusted Receive Timestamp (RX_STAMP field in the RX_TIME register)
--    * Adjusted Transmit Timestamp (TX_STAMP field in the TX_TIME register)
--
--  The following registers ignore the 9 least significant bits, providing a
--  granularity of 8.013 nanoseconds:
--    * System Time Counter (SYS_TIME register)
--    * Delayed Send or Receive Time (DX_TIME register)
--    * Raw Receive Timestamp (RX_RAWST field in the RX_TIME register)
--    * Raw Transmit Timestamp (TX_RAWST field in the TX_TIME register)
--
--  To manage the two time stamp precisions, the System_Time package defines
--  two types:
--    * Fine_System_Time, capable of the full 15.65 picosecond precision.
--    * Coarse_System_Time, capable of the restricted 8.013 nanosecond
--      precision.
--
--  For both of these types, conversion functions are defined to convert to and
--  from the 40-bit representation type that is used by the DW1000 register
--  set. The To_Bits_40 function converts from either Fine_System_Time or
--  Coarse_System_Time to the Bits_40 type. The To_Fine_System_Time and
--  To_Coarse_System_Time functions convert from the Bits_40 representation to
--  the Fine_System_Time and Coarse_System_Time types respectively.
--
--  Furthermore, the antenna delay is also measured in units of
--  15.65 picoseconds, but only has a 16-bit range (compared to the 40-bit
--  timestamps with a much bigger range). The antenna delay is represented
--  as the type Antenna_Delay_Time, which is a subtype of Fine_System_Time
--  with a maximum value of about 1.0256 microseconds.
--
--  For the antenna delay there are two conversion functions: To_Bits_16 and
--  To_Antenna_Delay_Time. The To_Bits_16 function converts from the
--  Antenna_Delay_Time type to its 16-bit representation. The
--  To_Antenna_Delay_Time function converts the other way; from the 16-bit
--  representation to the Antenna_Delay_Time type.
