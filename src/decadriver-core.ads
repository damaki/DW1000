--  @summary
--  High-level Ravenscar driver for typical usage of the DW1000.
--
--  @description
--  This driver provides a high-level API for configuring and using the DW1000.
--
--  This driver consists of three protected objects:
--    * Driver: Provides general configuration for the DW1000.
--    * Receiver: Provides functionality for receiving packets.
--    * Transmitter: Provides functionality for transmitting packets.
--
--  Before the DW1000 can be used, it must be initialized and configured.
--  This is done using the Driver.Initialize and Driver.Configure procedures.
--  The Initialize procedure initializes the DW1000 and, if specified by the
--  user, loads certain values from the DW1000 OTP memory, such as the antenna
--  delay. Below is an example of initializing the DW1000 and driver:
--
--     DecaDriver.Core.Driver.Initialize (Load_Antenna_Delay   => True,
--                                        Load_XTAL_Trim       => True,
--                                        Load_Tx_Power_Levels => True,
--                                        Load_UCode_From_ROM  => True);
--
--  After the DW1000 has been initialized, it can be set to a specific
--  configuration (UWB channel, PRF, preamble code, etc...) using the Configure
--  procedure. Below is an example of configuring the DW1000:
--
--     DecaDriver.Core.Driver.Configure (DecaDriver.Configuration_Type'
--        (Channel             => 1,
--         PRF                 => DW1000.Driver.PRF_64MHz,
--         Tx_Preamble_Length  => DW1000.Driver.PLEN_1024,
--         Tx_PAC              => DW1000.Driver.PAC_32,
--         Tx_Preamble_Code    => 9,
--         Rx_Preamble_Code    => 9,
--         Use_Nonstandard_SFD => False,
--         Data_Rate           => DW1000.Driver.Data_Rate_850k,
--         PHR_Mode            => DW1000.Driver.Standard_Frames,
--         Enable_Smart_Power  => True));
--
--  Note that some configuration parameters use values that are defined in the
--  package DW1000.Driver.
--
--  If the transmitter is to be used, then the transmit power must be
--  configured to ensure that the DW1000 transmits at a suitable power level
--  within the -41.3 dBm/MHz regulatory limit. The transmit power depends on
--  the UWB channel and PRF that has been configured, as well as the specific
--  RF circuitry and antenna that is being used.
--
--  Furthermore, the DW1000 supports two modes of transmit power: manual
--  transmit power and smart transmit power. In the manual transmit power mode
--  the power for the SHR and PHR portions of the physical frame are configured
--  independently. In the smart transmit power mode different levels of
--  transmit power can be configured for different physical frame lengths;
--  shorter frames can be configured to transmit at a higher power.
--
--  The power level is configured using a combination of a coarse gain and fine
--  gain values. The coarse gain permits the range 0.0 .. 18.0 dB in steps of
--  3 dB, and the fine gain permits the range 0.0 .. 15.5 dB in steps of
--- 0.5 dB. The coarse gain output can also be disabled.
--
--  Below is an example of configuring the DW1000 to operate in manual
--  transmit power mode, with the SHR and PHR portions of the frame configured
--  to transmit with a total gain of 19.5 dBm:
--
--     DecaDriver.Tx.Transmitter.Configure_Tx_Power
--       (Smart_Tx_Power_Enabled => False,
--        Boost_SHR => (Coarse_Gain_Enabled => True,
--                      Coarse_Gain         => 9.0,
--                      Fine_Gain           => 10.5),
--        Boost_PHR => (Coarse_Gain_Enabled => True,
--                      Coarse_Gain         => 9.0,
--                      Fine_Gain           => 10.5));
--
--  Since the transmit power is different for each hardware design this driver
--  cannot automatically configure the correct transmit power. The host
--  application must define the power to use for each UWB channel and PRF.
--  The package EVB1000_Tx_Power defines reference values, suitable for use
--  with the DecaWave EVB1000 evaluation boards using the 0 dBi antenna.
--
--  Once the driver is initialized and configured then packets can be sent
--  and received. Sending a packet is split into the following steps:
--    1. Write the data into the DW1000 transmit buffer.
--    2. Set the frame length information.
--    3. Start the transmission.
--
--  Below is an example of sending a zeroized packet of 10 bytes:
--
--     declare
--        Data : DW1000.Types.Byte_Array(1 .. 10) := (others => 0);
--     begin
--        DecaDriver.Tx.Transmitter.Set_Tx_Data (Data   => Data,
--                                               Offset => 0);
--        DecaDriver.Tx.Transmitter.Set_Tx_Frame_Length
--           (Length => Data'Length,
--            Offset => 0);
--        DecaDriver.Tx.Transmitter.Start_Tx_Immediate (Rx_After_Tx => False);
--     end;
--
--  Note that the receiver can be automatically enabled by the DW1000 after the
--  transmission has completed. This feature is enabled by setting Rx_After_Tx
--  to True when calling Start_Tx_Immediate.
--
--  To wait for the transmission to be completed, you can wait using the
--  Wait_For_Tx_Complete entry. This entry will block until the DW1000 signals
--  to the driver that the transmission has been completed. An example is shown
--  below:
--
--     DecaDriver.Tx.Transmitter.Wait_For_Tx_Complete;
--
--  Packets can only be received when the receiver is enabled. To enable the
--  receiver immediately (without delay), then use the
--  Receiver.Start_Rx_Immediate procedure. Then, to block until a packet is
--  received, use the Receiver.Wait entry. An example of waiting for a packet
--  is shown below:
--
--     declare
--        Frame_Data : DW1000.Types.Byte_Array (DecaDriver.Frame_Length_Number);
--        Length     : DW1000.Types.Frame_Length_Number;
--        Timestamp  : DW1000.System_Time.Fine_System_Time;
--        Error      : DecaDriver.Rx.Rx_Errors;
--        Overrun    : Boolean;
--     begin
--        DecaDriver.Rx.Receiver.Start_Rx_Immediate;
--        DecaDriver.Rx.Receiver.Wait (Frame     => Frame_Data,
--                                     Length    => Length,
--                                     Timestamp => Timestamp,
--                                     Error     => Error,
--                                     Overrun   => Overrun);
--
--        if Error = DecaDriver.Rx.No_Error then
--           --  No error occurred
--        else
--           --  An error occurred during packet reception.
--        end if;
--
--        if Overrun then
--           -- A packet was received before this packet, but it was dropped
--           -- because there was no free space in the receive queue.
--        end if;
--     end;
--
--  During packet reception it is possible for several different types of error
--  to occur. The Receiver driver can be configured to ignore certain errors,
--  so that the Wait entry will only wait for valid frames to be received.
--  To configure which errors are filtered, use the Driver.Configure_Errors
--  procedure. An example of using this procedure to disable all receive error
--  notifications (only wait for valid packets) is shown below:
--
--     DecaDriver.Core.Driver.Configure_Errors (Frame_Timeout => False,
--                                              SFD_Timeout   => False,
--                                              PHR_Error     => False,
--                                              RS_Error      => False,
--                                              FCS_Error     => False);
--
--  By default, all errors are suppressed so that the Receiver.Wait entry will
--  only capture frames that are received without errors.
--
--  It is possible to enable the transmitter or receiver at a specific time,
--  rather than starting the transmission/reception immediately. This is known
--  as the "delayed tx/rx" feature. Typically, this is used to enable the
--  transmitter or receiver after a delay relative to a previous transmission
--  or reception. Below is an example of waiting for a packet to be received,
--  and then transmitting the received packet 10 milliseconds after the packet
--  was received:
--
--     declare
--        Frame_Data : DW1000.Types.Byte_Array (DecaDriver.Frame_Length_Number);
--        Length     : DW1000.Types.Frame_Length_Number;
--        Rx_Time    : DW1000.System_Time.Fine_System_Time;
--        Error      : DecaDriver.Rx.Rx_Errors;
--        Overrun    : Boolean;
--
--        Tx_Time    : DW1000.System_Time.Coarse_System_Time;
--        Tx_Result  : DW1000.Driver.Result_Codes;
--     begin
--        --  Wait for a packet
--        DecaDriver.Rx.Receiver.Start_Rx_Immediate;
--        DecaDriver.Rx.Receiver.Wait (Frame     => Frame_Data,
--                                     Length    => Length,
--                                     Timestamp => Rx_Time,
--                                     Error     => Error,
--                                     Overrun   => Overrun);
--
--        if Error = DecaDriver.Rx.No_Error then
--           --  Compute the transmit time (10 ms after the receive time)
--           Tx_Time :=
--              DW1000.System_Time.To_Coarse_System_Time
--                 (DW1000.System_Time.System_Time_Offset (Rx_Time, 0.01));
--
--           -- Configure the time at which the transmitter should be enabled
--           DecaDriver.Tx.Transmitter.Set_Delayed_Tx_Time (Time => Tx_Time);
--
--           -- Begin the delayed transmission
--           DecaDriver.Tx.Transmitter.Start_Tx_Delayed
--              (Rx_After_Tx => False,
--               Result      => Tx_Result);
--
--           if Result = DW1000.Driver.Success then
--              -- The delayed transmission was configured successfully.
--           else
--              -- Delayed transmit failed. The transmit time is already passed
--           end if;
--        end if;
--     end;
--
--  The delayed transmission can fail if the target transmit time has already
--  passed when Transmitter.Start_Tx_Delayed is called. E.g. in the above
--  example, the delayed transmit will fail if Start_Tx_Delayed is called after
--  the 10 ms delay has already passed. This can happen in cases such as the
--  task being blocked for too long by a higher-priority task.
