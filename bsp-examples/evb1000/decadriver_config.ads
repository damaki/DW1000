package DecaDriver_Config
is

   DW1000_IRQ_Id : constant Ada.Interrupts.Interrupt_ID
     := Ada.Interrupts.Names.EXTI9_5_Interrupt;
   --  The interrupt ID for the DW1000 IRQ line.

   Driver_Priority : constant System.Interrupt_Priority
     := System.Interrupt_Priority'Last;
   --  The interrupt priority used for the DecaDriver's protected objects.

   Receiver_Queue_Length : constant Positive := 2;
   --  The length of the receiver queue used to hold received packets
   --  on the host MCU side.
   --
   --  The minimum value for this configuration parameter is 2.
   --
   --  Larger values for this configuration parameter make it less likely for
   --  a packet to be missed (overrun condition). However, larger values will
   --  use more memory.

   Maximum_Receive_Frame_Length : constant Positive := 1024;
   --  Controls the buffer size used for storing received frames in the
   --  receiver driver queue.
   --
   --  The minimum permitted value is 1.
   --  The maximum permitted value is 1024.
   --
   --  The DW1000 supports extended frame lengths of up to 1024 bytes. However,
   --  the IEEE 802.15.4-2011 standard restricts the physical frame size to
   --  127 bytes (see the constant aMaxPHYPacketSize in Table 70 in
   --  Section 9.2 of the IEEE 802.15.4-2011 standard).
   --
   --  If you are using the extended capabilities of the DW1000 then this
   --  constant should be set to 1024.
   --
   --  Otherwise, if you are only using frames up to the maximum size set in
   --  the standard (127 bytes) then you can set this constant to 127 to
   --  reduce the amount of memory used by the receiver driver's queue.
   --
   --  If a frame is received by the driver whose length is smaller than this
   --  constant then the received frame is truncated to this length. For
   --  example, if Maximum_Receive_Frame_Size is set to 50, and a frame is
   --  received with a length of 62 bytes, then the received frame is truncated
   --  to the first 50 bytes (the last 12 bytes are ignored by the driver).
